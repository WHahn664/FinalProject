# FinalProject
This final project focuses on creating 4 different types of regression models based on meteorlogical data in the forestfires.csv data set. We will then be comparing those models based on three metrics mean RMSE (log), std RMSE (log), mean R2 (log). We will be using temp (Celsius), RH (percentage), wind (km/hr) speed, and rain (mm/m2) as the independent variables. We will also be using the dependent variable area (hectares). We will also be applying a logarithmic transformation on the area variable to stabilize the variance within the area variable. We will also be comparing the three metrics of each model before and after applying logartihimc transformation on the area variable. The 4 types of models that will be compared are: linear regression model, decision tree model, random forest model, and support vector machine model.
